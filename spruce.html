                  <h2>The Project</h2>
                  <p>
                      Design a native gardening app for Android and iOS mobile devices, ensuring adherence to Android Material Design specifications and iOS Design Guidelines. This gardening app, specific to indoor gardening during its early stages, will allow users to keep on schedule with small tasks like watering and adjusting light levels for their pot plants.
                  </p>
                  <h2>The Goal</h2>
                  <p>
                      To create an app that demystifies the process of caring for a plant. The app should be designed with easy to use features and above all, must not complicate the scheduling process. It should provide customisation elements such as name and option to photograph plants, and provide the user with enough information to successfully care for their indoor plants.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Discovery</h2>
                  <p>
                      This project started with research into similar apps on the market. Initially, I wanted to know what solutions others had come up with and how varied these apps were in terms of simplicity and complexity. Some were designed for horticulturalists or those who maintained a large scale plot of land and were removed from the competitive analysis. This level of complexity wasn’t required for the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      A handful of apps did a similar job and their solutions became part of my comparison check. Some features like fertilising and repotting schedules, while nice to have, weren’t deemed imperative for this first iteration. Instead, my focus was on functionality and ease of use. For example, I found that sliders were a great tool for quickly selecting options rather than tick box style interfaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Discussions with potential users soon proved that simplicity was key to the overall design. Where plant watering featured heavily in the discussion, the participant also recognised that watering is important for plants but were unaware of how much or how often to water.
                  </p>
                  <h2>What went well</h2>
                  <p>
                      I enjoyed the various iterations this project took. With a limited amount of time to work on this each week, I was forced to evaluate what was necessary and what could be left out of the project for now. This gave the overall project a focus on only the most important functions.
                  </p>
                  <h2>What to improve</h2>
                  <p>
                      Though I received great feedback on the overall design and I was happy with the colour palette I used, I laboured over the prototype before releasing it for feedback. The iteration phases were a learning curve and taught me that during the design and creation stages, feedback is powerfully constructive for the development of the project and can avoid pitfalls such as working on something that may not be the right fit for the design.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Moving forward, I will also be researching and learning more about design hierarchy. This is an area where I can focus my skills and train my eye to be more confident with design decisions.
